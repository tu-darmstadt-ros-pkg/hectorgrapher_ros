# HectorGrapher ROS Integration

## Purpose

HectorGrapher is a robust, continuous-time SLAM framework for mobile rescue robots, forked from [Cartographer](https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer).
The framework is developed for the needs of robust and efficient 3D SLAM for the mobile ground robots used for urban search and rescue research at 
[Team Hector](https://www.teamhector.de/) and the 
[German Center for Rescue Robotics (DRZ)](https://rettungsrobotik.de/en/).
